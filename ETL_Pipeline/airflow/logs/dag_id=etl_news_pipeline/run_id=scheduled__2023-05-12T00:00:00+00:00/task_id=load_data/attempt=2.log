The independent review will look at the way in which decisions are made and overseen within PwC, including how financial goals, values and strategic objectives are balanced and prioritised. It will examine the way in which partners and staff are held accountable for their responsibilities, as well as assess the values and behaviours that exist at all levels within the firm., will lead a review of the consultancy firm’s governance, accountability and culture More on Peter Dutton’s ‘thought bubble’ this morning I just wanted to go back to the PM’s presser in Adelaide this morning, where he addressed the opposition’s proposal to allow people on unemployment benefits to work up to 10 hours without cutting the payment. Albanese called it a “thought bubble,” but conceded that the employment services aren’t “working to the extent that they should”: It was thought bubble from Peter Dutton. They don’t take advantage of the earning capacity which is there now to earn additional money, and then there’s a taper rate which is available. Clearly, employment services aren’t working to the extent that they should when you have an unemployment rate of just 3.5% – a historic low – but you still have people looking to work. Some of the system that’s been established by our predecessors is about ticking the boxes rather than providing that support.

This is a gap that is there with the Greens political party between their rhetoric and their delivery. This is them putting politics before what is needed. You can’t say you support social housing, and then vote against it. Albanese also questioned the basis upon which the Greens aren’t supporting the bill because it relies upon a future fund: The truth is that the Greens political party would rather posture than vote for what is before the parliament. They need to explain that contradiction which is there. And I’ve seen some of their absurd comments speaking about gambling. If that is the case that setting up a fund and you use vested interests to achieve outcomes, they must be horrified at the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and what it does. They must be terrified about superannuation, which is exactly how superannuation operates for individuals in this country. And I would have thought that compulsory superannuation was something that the Greens party supported. But if you look at their rhetoric, it is just nonsense. It is just grandstanding and immaturity, and it’s why you need a party of majority government to actually be in charge, because we’re interested in outcomes, and the Greens political party seem to be just interested in playing politics. Those of us on the east coast won’t be putting our hot water bottles and duvets away any time soon, there’s another cold front on the way. A cold front will bring a wintery change to south-east Australia over the coming days.The front will reach western Tasmania later today and will move into the south-east states on Tuesday and Wednesday.

She said in a statement: We are the caretakers of this land where we camp, fish, hunt, gather and share our stories that extend across Australia. This determination is the effort of over 30 years’ hard work, and we now invite pastoralists and businesses to negotiate with us regarding matters on our country. The Aboriginal affairs minister, Kyam Maher, said he was pleased the state and the Nauo people have been able to resolve the native title claim by consent. This significant step for the Nauo people, and for reconciliation in this state, is the result of many years of hard work and perseverance, and I commend the efforts of everyone involved. Nauo people granted native title over 8,000 sq km in SA The Nauo people have been granted native title over almost 8,000 square kilometres on South Australia’s Eyre peninsula, AAP reports. The federal court on Monday presented the traditional owners with their native title determination at a special hearing on country. It includes the towns of Palkagee, Mount Joy, Coolillie, Polda, Sheringa, Kiana, Mitchell, Kapinnie, Coulta, Wangary and Coffin Bay along with the Coffin Bay and Lincoln national parks. Platypus return to Royal national park for first time in 50 years When a little platypus wandered into the waters of the Sydney’s Royal national park this weekend it was the first of its species to do so in over half a century. A translocation program is bringing nine platypus from southern NSW to the national park in the hope of re-establishing a self sustaining population after 50 years of being locally extinct. The project is a collaboration between the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), Taronga Conservation Society Australia, UNSW Sydney and WWF-Australia. Five female platypus have been released into the park so far and another four males will be released this coming week once the females have successfully established their territory. Woman rescued after boat sinks off Qld’s Fraser Island A woman has been rescued while the search for a man continues after the pair were reported missing from a sinking vessel in water off Queensland’s Fraser Island. Two people were on board the vessel of the northern tip of the island, also known as K’gari, when they radioed for help about 8.30pm on Sunday, police said. Police and volunteer marine services began an air and water search before rescue helicopter crews plucked the woman from the water about 11.30am on Monday. She will be airlifted to Bundaberg Hospital for treatment. The search involving multiple aircraft and vessels continues for a missing male. - AAP Lehrmann ‘convicted in the media before the trial started’, lawyer says Bruce Lehrmann’s lawyer has said his client was denied the presumption of innocence because it was widely accepted that Brittany Higgins, who alleged that he had raped her, was a “victim”. Steven Whybrow said he had a “problem” with Higgins being referred to as “the victim” instead of “the complainant”, as well as the optics of Higgins being accompanied to court by the victims of crime commissioner, Heidi Yates. Speaking at the ongoing inquiry into Lehrmann’s trial, Whybrow also said the ACT’s director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, stated publicly that there was “a reasonable prospect of conviction” of Lehrmann after the trial was discontinued. Lehrmann was “convicted in the media before the trial started”, he said. Lehrmann has consistently denied allegations that he raped Brittany Higgins, a colleague and fellow political staffer, in the office of the then defence industry minister, Linda Reynolds, in March 2019. He pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent, denying that any sexual activity had occurred. Carroll says he’s very excited for the new technology to be rolled out: This is the big step change that we’ve needed in Melbourne. Right around the world, we’re one of the few countries that is still using a card-based system. New Myki system to begin trials in 2024 Some more information on the timeline from Carroll. He says Conduent will take over from Myki’s existing operator – NTT data from 1 December, with trials of the new system to begin in 2024 before a broader rollout in 2025. He says some ticket readers – not all – will need to be replaced: We think some readers will need to be placed, particularly the most outdated one, obviously with the new technology … but we also don’t know what the future holds or indeed possesses. So we want the modern platform that will be able to use anything that may be devised or indeed innovated going forward.
