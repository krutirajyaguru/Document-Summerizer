What is Text Summarization?![ref3]

Text  Summarization  is  the  process  of  ![](Aspose.Words.2c2667e0-6c38-4f40-b43f-ed657d0c968b.007.png)shortening  a  set  of  data  computationally,  to  create  a  subset  that  represents  the  most  important  or  relevant  information  within  the  original content.

Airflow![ref3]

Airflow is an open-source platform used for orchestrating and scheduling complex workflows and data pipelines. It allows users to define, schedule, and monitor workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). 

A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is a way to represent the flow of tasks. Think of it like a flowchart, where tasks are represented as boxes, and arrows show the order in which they should be executed.
